Team Contract

| Name | Phone Number | Email |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| Alexandria Cade | (phone number) | (email) |

## Structure

We have a Teams channel and chat that will be used primarily when needed to discuss updates to code, new findings, and issues or challenges we are facing along with client meet up times and what works best for everyone.

## Procedures

We plan to divide up tasks/responsibilities, keep in contact with the group on updates with client or code through Teams or email, be willing to switch roles when needed to get a task finished, be open to new ideas and challenges we may face, and work through those issues over Teams, email, or in person at a group meeting or in class when needed.

## Expectations

As long as people are paying attention to the Teams channel and or the Teams chat message group and are attentive and contributing to the project inside and outside of their assigned roles when needed, this should be the only real expectations.

## Accountability

Within the Teams chat or even through an email everyone should be trying to check in on progress within the group. Then we will have class and group meetings to check in with folks and make sure different aspects of the app are getting done.

These are some examples:

- "How is the app design going?"
- "Are the unit tests all caught up with new classes?"
- "Let me know if I can help with _____ if you need, just want to make sure we get that done."

## Consequences

If a group member(s) is not contributing to some part of the project they should have been then a Teams chat message or email to the group member(s) directly would be the first course of action and if the lack of work continues or a response is not given then potentially a meeting with Dr. Goadrich would need to be put together to help resolve the issue.

## Responsibilities

- Alexandria:

- Gunner:

- Nard:

- Garrett: I plan to be involved in 2 main roles, but willing to work in any other roles that my team needs me in. These roles are:
  - Client Inferfacer
  - GUI Designer

I plan to be in charge of reaching out to the client about meetings and updates as it relates to the project whether through email, Slack, or video chats if neeeded. I also plan to work directly with the GUI we are designer primarily with the sensors and inner workings of the app, along with some of the layouts/designs if needed. I recognize that others will want to probably contribute in these areas and I would welcome others in my team stepping in if they want to or would like to switch roles. I will be felxible within these assigned roles under the assumption that others in my team could step in if needed.
